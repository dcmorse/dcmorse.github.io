description: "This was a week's project for a job application to showcase my React.js skillset. The site displays information about movies with the word 'Super' in the title by querying the <a href='https://www.omdbapi.com/' target='_blank'>omdb api</a>. It includes a modal window, accessibility provisions, a test suite, and is generally a good indicator of my Best React Practices. At time of writing, I'd use it as a base if I were to start a new react project tomorrow. "
