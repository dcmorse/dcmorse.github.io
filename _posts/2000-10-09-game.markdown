description: "Early in my life I went absolutely ham and built a 2D side-scrolling, multi-player video game for Linux: Copter Commander. It used OpenGL 1.5 and texture mapping for rotating sprites, had both co-op and competitive play, and an embedded level design language and a sort of custom Object Oriented language that facilitated information hiding to clients. Copter Commander was based on the classic games Rescue Raiders and Armor Alley."
