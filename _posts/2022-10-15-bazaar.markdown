description: "Worldwide Technology's customer wanted a virtual bazaar where creators could upload digital artifacts and sell them to other creators. Over the two years of this project, my responsibilities evolved from coding the React front end, to maintaining & securing infrastructure as a member of the DevOps team, to building the observability tools for launch day."
