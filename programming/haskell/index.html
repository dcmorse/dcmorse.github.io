        <h1>Haskell</h1>

        <p>
          Haskell is a beautiful and amazing language. Everyone would
          benefit from learning it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Haskell is so good at preventing programmer mistakes, that
          it's not unusual for a newly authored program to run correctly
          the first time. Let that sink in for a minute. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, Haskell is incredibly expressive. The built in
          type checker wipes out 90% of the need to declare
          types. Heck, even writing out the names of formal parameters
          is often optimized out - look at slices and partial
          application and points-free function definitions. Ruby
          boasts about its consicision and power, but it can't hold a
          candle to the expressive power of Haskell.
        </p>

        <h4>My Experience</h4>
        <p>
          I've been doing intermittant hobbyist work spanning years,
          but rarely intensely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The largest app I wrote was a public
          transit route finder that used screen-scraped schedules from
          my home city's transit system. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also used it to tear up some Project Euler and
          Hackerrank.com challenges. It's really not fair to the
          tests, but there's no points for doing those things in
          assembly, either.
        </p>

        <h4>It's Limits, My Limits</h4>
        <p>
          Haskell seems to have a curse of being the programming
          language of choice for people who <em>only</em> speak in
          extremely rarified math terms. Their reasoning leaves me
          quite befuddled at times. This means I have to don
          battlepants every time I want to grasp some illnamed
          concept. The first such concept you'll hit will be Monads,
          but there are tons of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haskell places an enormous <i>syntactic tax</i> on side
          effects. That is, performing side effects - like drawing a
          polygon, writing a database, or printing to a file - is an
          affront to other Haskell code, and it has to be handled with
          special, pesky syntax and isolated to short depths in the
          call tree. It's both brilliant and very, very hard to live
          with. Scala is a mid-flight course correction - one wonders
          if thye've got the right idea.
        </p>
